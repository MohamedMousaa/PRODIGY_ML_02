# Customer Segmentation with K-means Clustering

## Overview

This project focuses on utilizing K-means clustering algorithm to perform customer segmentation based on their purchase history. By analyzing data from the "Mall Customer Segmentation Data" dataset available on Kaggle, we aim to identify distinct customer segments to facilitate targeted marketing strategies.

## Dataset
Dataset Name: Mall Customer Segmentation Data

Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

Description: The dataset includes basic information about customers such as Customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score. Spending score is assigned based on customer behavior and purchasing data.

## Project Structure
